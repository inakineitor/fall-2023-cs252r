# Ideas for Improvments
- Caching of expression results under examples
- Aggressive type narrowing using cached types from previous interpretation (wouldn't work in recursive cases)
- Implementing the machine learning portion of BUSLE
- Adding another search guiding factor, like the cost to run of each function
